# xplm-sys: Rust bindings for the X-Plane plugin SDK #

This library provides Rust bindings to the X-Plane plugin SDK.

## SDK versions ##

This crate supports SDK version 4.0.1, which is supported on X-Plane 12.04 and later. Plugins can be used with earlier X-Plane versions as long as they do not use newer APIs.

Some features in earlier versions of the SDK have been removed. This library currently does not provide a way to access them.

## Documentation ##

The types and functions are documented on [the X-Plane plugin API website](http://developer.x-plane.com/sdk/).

## Compiling and linking ##

This library currently can be compiled on Mac OS, Linux, and Windows.

On Mac OS and Windows, plugins must be dynamically linked with libraries that
provide stub implementations of the SDK functions. This crate includes those
libraries and tells Cargo to link them.
